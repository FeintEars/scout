This is a try to fork a [Scout library](https://github.com/TimHanewich/scout) to switch it from MicroPython to full Python and use it on Raspberry Pi 4 base.

1. Install the [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) to your TF card
2. Replace the [config.txt file](https://github.com/FeintEars/scout/blob/master/config.txt) in root of your TF card
3. Enable Raspberry and run `python src/main.py` script
